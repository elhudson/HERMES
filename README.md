# HERMES
Humanitarian Efficient Resource Management Endowment System. Built for WHACK 2022.

Haiti has the highest per capita distribution of aid in the entire world, but its per-capita GDP has decreased by a steady 2% annually. Oversaturation of aid in overlapping sectors, paired with distrust in a very weak and corrupt government, has resulted in an extremely inefficient aid distribution network that doesn’t meet the needs of the Haitian people.

HERMES was designed to analyse IATI NGO data and assign active NGOs an “effectivity score” which will be used jointly with a state contract system to effectively allocate humanitarian aid.
